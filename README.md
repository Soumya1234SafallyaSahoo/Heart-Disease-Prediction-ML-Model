Project Overview
CardioCare is a health-tech solution that utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It aims to assist doctors and individuals in early risk identification, prevention, and better clinical decisions.

Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Several challenges hinder effective prevention and diagnosis:

Lack of Early Detection: Many individuals are unaware of their heart condition until itâ€™s too late.

Unanalyzed Health Data: Patient data remains underutilized in preventive care.

Inaccurate Risk Assessment: Traditional checkups may miss subtle indicators.

Delayed Diagnosis: Manual evaluations can be time-consuming and inconsistent.

Lack of Accessible Tools: Rural areas lack smart diagnostic solutions.

Solution
CardioCare offers a data-driven system that supports early diagnosis and personalized care through:

Real-Time Prediction
Instant risk prediction using machine learning models

User-friendly interface for data input and immediate feedback

Helps clinicians and patients take preventive actions

Predictive Analytics
Models trained on diverse health indicators: age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG, heart rate, etc.

Prediction of disease likelihood with high accuracy

Visualization of key risk factors

Accessible Platform
Web/mobile interface for hospitals or remote users

Can be integrated with EHR systems for clinical use

Lightweight system for community health workers

Technical Stack
Frontend
Streamlit / Flutter for user interface (depending on use case)

Clean UI for entering and viewing patient data

Backend
Python for core ML logic

Scikit-learn / XGBoost / Logistic Regression for heart disease prediction

REST API for model inference (optional with Flask or FastAPI)

Data & Model
Trained on UCI Heart Disease dataset

Feature selection and preprocessing included
